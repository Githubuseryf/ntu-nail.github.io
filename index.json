In this paper, we present Program-Guided Fact-Checking (ProgramFC), a novel fact-checking model that decomposes complex claims into simpler sub-tasks that can be solved using a shared library of specialized functions. We first leverage the in-context learning ability of large language models to generate reasoning programs to guide the verification process. Afterward, we execute the program by delegating each sub-task to the corresponding sub-task handler. This process makes our model both explanatory and data-efficient, providing clear explanations of its reasoning process and requiring minimal training data. We evaluate ProgramFC on two challenging fact-checking datasets and show that it outperforms seven fact-checking baselines across different settings of evidence availability, with explicit output programs that benefit human debugging.

It is classified into two categories depending on the resolved objects, namely entity coreference resolution and event coreference resolution. Predicting coreference connections and identifying mentions/triggers are the major challenges in coreference resolution, because these implicit relationships are particularly difficult in natural language understanding in downstream tasks. Coreference resolution techniques have experienced considerable advances in recent years, encouraging us to review this task in the following aspects:current employed evaluation metrics, datasets, and methods. We investigate 10 widely used metrics, 18 datasets and 4 main technical trends in this survey.

IE involves several subtasks, such as named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE), and coreference resolution (CR). The early IE models tend to treat each subtask as a separate task or to apply a sequential pipeline approach, which can lead to cascading errors and obfuscation of the inherent relationship between tasks. Recent research has shown that it is advantageous to incorporate the interdependence of subtasks and optimize performance through joint learning. However, they do not properly model the interaction between tasks, either by modeling the subtasks sequentially or by using shared input data. Inspired by human reasoning, a graph-based multitask IE framework is presented that facilitates the interaction between several IE tasks capable of capturing both local and global information. Graphs were constructed by selecting the most confident entity spans and coupling them with a confidence-weighted relation type and a confidence-weighted coreference. Additionally, in the study, a dynamic span graph approach was employed, where span updates were propagated across both the coreference and the relation graph. This allowed useful information to be learned from a broader context by enhancing interaction across different IE tasks. The input data were globally shared, and the interaction between subtasks was fully exploited, avoiding cascading errors. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed multitask IE framework outperforms the state-of-the-art in multiple information extraction tasks spanning a variety of datasets. The relative error reductions range from 0.19 to 3.74%. This paper presents the feasibility of a cognitively-inspired unified graph-based information extraction framework, which is shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple IE tasks across various domains. The framework’s ability to enhance interaction across tasks allows it to learn valuable information from a broader context.","tags":["CC"],"title":"A Novel, Cognitively Inspired, Unified Graph-based Multi-Task Framework for Information Extraction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thong Nguyen","Xiaobao Wu","Luu Anh Tuan","Zhen Hai","Lidong Bing"],"categories":null,"content":"https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.686/\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8d87bc4690b25a8fef6d862b38d5a955","permalink":"https://ntu-nail.github.io/publication/adaptive-contrastive-learning-on-multimodal-transformer-for-review-helpfulness-prediction/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/adaptive-contrastive-learning-on-multimodal-transformer-for-review-helpfulness-prediction/","section":"publication","summary":"Modern Review Helpfulness Prediction systems are dependent upon multiple modalities, typically texts and images.

In this paper, we propose MDSCM - a Multi-attention based Depthwise Separable Convolutional Model for speech emotional feature extraction that can reduce the feature redundancy through separating spatialwise convolution and channel-wise convolution. MDSCM also enhances the feature discriminability by the multi-attention module that focuses on learning features with more emotional information. In addition, we propose an Audio-Visual Domain Adaptation Learning paradigm (AVDAL) to learn an audiovisual emotion-identity space. A shared audio-visual representation encoder is built to transfer the emotional knowledge learned from the visual domain to complement and enhance the emotional features that only extracted from speech. Domain classifier and emotion classifier are used for encoder training to reduce the mismatching of domain features, and enhance the discriminability of features for emotion recognition. The experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art speech emotion recognition systems, achieving 72.43% on weighted accuracy and 73.22% on unweighted accuracy.","tags":["Interspeech"],"title":"Audio-Visual Domain Adaptation Feature Fusion for Speech Emotion Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vijay Prakash Dwivedi","Chaitanya K.

This emerging field has witnessed an extensive growth of promising techniques that have been applied with success to computer science, mathematics, biology, physics and chemistry. But for any successful field to become mainstream and reliable, benchmarks must be developed to quantify progress. This led us in March 2020 to release a benchmark framework that i) comprises of a diverse collection of mathematical and real-world graphs, ii) enables fair model comparison with the same parameter budget to identify key architectures, iii) has an open-source, easy-to-use and reproducible code infrastructure, and iv) is flexible for researchers to experiment with new theoretical ideas. As of December 2022, the GitHub repository has reached 2,000 stars and 380 forks, which demonstrates the utility of the proposed open-source framework through the wide usage by the GNN community. In this paper, we present an updated version of our benchmark with a concise presentation of the aforementioned framework characteristics, an additional medium-sized molecular dataset AQSOL, similar to the popular ZINC, but with a real-world measured chemical target, and discuss how this framework can be leveraged to explore new GNN designs and insights. As a proof of value of our benchmark, we study the case of graph positional encoding (PE) in GNNs, which was introduced with this benchmark and has since spurred interest of exploring more powerful PE for Transformers and GNNs in a robust experimental setting.","tags":["JMRL"],"title":"Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luu Anh Tuan","Darsh J Shah","Regina Barzilay"],"categories":null,"content":"https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.477/\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"48e603cf511fe2c8716316196e0d82f1","permalink":"https://ntu-nail.github.io/publication/capturing-greater-context-for-question-generation/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/capturing-greater-context-for-question-generation/","section":"publication","summary":"Automatic question generation can benefit many applications ranging from dialogue systems to reading comprehension. While questions are often asked with respect to long documents, there are many challenges with modeling such long documents. Many existing techniques generate questions by effectively looking at one sentence at a time, leading to questions that are easy and not reflective of the human process of question generation. Our goal is to incorporate interactions across multiple sentences to generate realistic questions for long documents. In order to link a broad document context to the target answer, we represent the relevant context via a multi-stage attention mechanism, which forms the foundation of a sequence to sequence model. We outperform state-of-the-art methods on question generation on three question-answering datasets -- SQuAD, MS MARCO and NewsQA.","tags":["ACL"],"title":"Capturing Greater Context for Question Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luu Anh Tuan","Jun Sun","Yang Liu","Jin Song Dong","Xiaohong Li","Thanh Tho Quan"],"categories":null,"content":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11704-012-2903-3\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6ed647b171a8d3897d21f8d17ff7a940","permalink":"https://ntu-nail.github.io/publication/seve-automatic-tool-for-verification-of-security-protocols/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/seve-automatic-tool-for-verification-of-security-protocols/","section":"publication","summary":"Security protocols play more and more important roles with wide use in many applications nowadays. Currently, there are many tools for specifying and verifying security protocols such as Casper/FDR, ProVerif, or AVISPA. In these tools, the intruder’s ability, which either needs to be specified explicitly or set by default, is not flexible in some circumstances. Moreover, whereas most of the existing tools focus on secrecy and authentication properties, few supports privacy properties like anonymity, receipt freeness, and coercion resistance, which are crucial in many applications such as in electronic voting systems or anonymous online transactions. In this paper, we introduce a framework for specifying security protocols in the labeled transition system (LTS) semantics model, which embeds the knowledge of the participants and parameterizes the ability of an attacker. Using this model, we give the formal definitions for three types of privacy properties based on trace equivalence and knowledge reasoning. The formal definitions for some other security properties, such as secrecy and authentication, are introduced under this framework, and the verification algorithms are also given. The results of this paper are embodied in the implementation of a SeVe module in a process analysis toolkit (PAT) model checker, which supports specifying, simulating, and verifying security protocols. The experimental results show that a SeVe module is capable of verifying many types of security protocols and complements the state-of-the-art security verifiers in several aspects. Moreover, it also proves the ability in building an automatic verifier for security protocols related to privacy type, which are mostly verified by hand now.","tags":["FCS"],"title":"SeVe - Automatic Tool for Verification of Security Protocols","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://ntu-nail.github.io/tour/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Yi Tay","Donovan Ong","Jie Fu","Alvin Chan","Nancy Chen","Luu Anh Tuan","Chris Pal"],"categories":null,"content":"https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.477/\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3b6aafba51c69ba421eeb81e89efd60a","permalink":"https://ntu-nail.github.io/publication/would-you-rather-a-new-benchmark-for-learning-machine-alignment-with-cultural-values-and-social-preferences/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/would-you-rather-a-new-benchmark-for-learning-machine-alignment-with-cultural-values-and-social-preferences/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding human preferences, along with cultural and social nuances, lives at the heart of natural language understanding. Concretely, we present a new task and corpus for learning alignments between machine and human preferences. Our newly introduced problem is concerned with predicting the preferable options from two sentences describing scenarios that may involve social and cultural situations. Our problem is framed as a natural language inference task with crowd-sourced preference votes by human players, obtained from a gamified voting platform. We benchmark several state-of-the-art neural models, along with BERT and friends on this task. Our experimental results show that current state-of-the-art NLP models still leave much room for improvement.","tags":["ACL"],"title":"Would you Rather?
